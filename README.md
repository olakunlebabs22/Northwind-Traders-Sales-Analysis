## Data Transformation
- I made sure that each field (data, text, integer, binary, etc.) in the dataset was formatted correctly.

## Findings 
The sales performance data for Northwind traders reveals a total sales figure of $1.35m with an average sales amount of $627 58. Notable city contributors include Cork and Graz each with sales surpassing $40,000. In terms of product categories, the top sellers were beverages dairy and seafood. White clover markets lead in company sales contributing over $15,000. April recorded the highest sales among the months analyzed.

## Conclusion
The business is doing well with strong beverage and dairy sales, there are significant opportunities for growth in underperforming areas and the variety of products sold in March also stands out as a month if particularly high indicating a seasonal trend or potential for media success

## Recommendations:
- Focus on underperforming areas: Cities like Rio de Janeiro and Cunevalde have limited sales. Marketing efforts and promotions should target these areas to increase productivity
- Diversification: Though beverages are the dominant product category, investments to promote other categories such as limited sales of spices products can contribute to the revenue generation various.
- Take advantage of higher sales: Products such as beverages and seafood that contribute significantly to sales should be promoted more through bundles or discounts to maximize revenue.
- Customer engagement: Many communication strategies, such as loyalty programs or personalized offers, can be used to retain high-end customers such as White Clover Market and turn them into high-spenders.


## Ways to increase sales:
- Promotional discounts: -Running time-limited offers during off-peak sales months can provide urgency and increase sales.
- Targeted marketing: Use customer behavior data to send personalized marketing messages that reflect their buying habits and preferences.
- Expand into new markets: Identify untapped areas or less popular products and focus on marketing to drive growth.
